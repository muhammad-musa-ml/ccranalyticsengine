## Floating Rate Notes (FRNs)

FRNs pay a floating coupon tied to a reference rate plus a spread.

### Key Features

- **Reference Rates:** SOFR, EURIBOR, SONIA, TONA
- **Reset Frequency:** Typically quarterly
- **Duration:** Very low (to next reset)
- **Rate Risk:** Minimal
- **Credit Risk:** Similar to fixed-rate bonds

### Caps and Floors

FRNs may include embedded options:
- **Cap:** Maximum coupon rate
- **Floor:** Minimum coupon rate (often 0%)

### Usage Example

```python
from products.python.fixed_income import FloatingRateNote

frn = FloatingRateNote(
    trade_id="FRN-001",
    trade_date=date(2024, 1, 15),
    issue_date=date(2024, 1, 15),
    maturity_date=date(2027, 1, 15),
    face_value=10000000,
    currency=Currency.USD,
    counterparty_id="CPY-001",
    spread=0.0075,  # 75 bps over SOFR
    reference_rate="SOFR",
    reset_frequency=PaymentFrequency.QUARTERLY,
    issuer_name="Bank ABC",
    floor=0.0,  # 0% floor
    is_long=True
)
```

    agency="FNMA",
    wac=0.04,  # 4% WAC
    wam=340,  # 340 months WAM
    is_long=True
)

result = mbs.price(market_data)
print(f"WAL: {result.components['wal']:.2f} years")
print(f"CPR: {result.components['cpr']:.1%}")
```

## Pricing Methodology

### Clean vs Dirty Price

```
Dirty Price = Clean Price + Accrued Interest
```

### Yield Calculations

**Yield to Maturity (YTM):**
```
P = Σ (C / (1+y)^t) + (F / (1+y)^n)
```

Where:
- P = Dirty price
- C = Coupon payment
- F = Face value
- y = YTM (semi-annual)
- n = Number of periods

### Duration & Convexity

**Macaulay Duration:**
```
D_mac = Σ (t × PV(CF_t)) / P
```

**Modified Duration:**
```
D_mod = D_mac / (1 + y/f)
```

Where f = frequency

**Convexity:**
```
C = Σ (t² × PV(CF_t)) / P
```

**Price Change Approximation:**
```
ΔP/P ≈ -D_mod × Δy + 0.5 × C × (Δy)²
```

---

## Risk Metrics

### DV01 (Dollar Duration)

```
DV01 = Modified Duration × Price × 0.0001
```

### CS01 (Credit Spread Sensitivity)

```
CS01 = Duration × Price × 0.0001 (for 1bp spread change)
```

### Greeks

| Greek | Description | Formula |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **DV01** | Interest rate sensitivity | D_mod × P × 0.0001 |
| **CS01** | Credit spread sensitivity | D × P × 0.0001 |
| **Convexity** | Second-order rate sensitivity | Σ(t² × PV) / P |

---

## SA-CCR Treatment

### Interest Rate Add-On

```
AddOn(IR) = SF × d × EffectiveNotional × MF
```

Where:
- SF = 0.50% for interest rate
- d = delta (±1 for linear)
- EffectiveNotional = Notional × Duration
- MF = √(min(M, 1))

### Credit Add-On

For corporate bonds:
```
AddOn(Credit) = SF(rating) × d × Notional × MF
```

SF varies by rating (0.38% for AAA to 6.00% for CCC).
