## SA-CCR Treatment for SFT

### Simplified Approach

For SFT transactions, SA-CCR uses a simplified approach:

```
EAD = max(0, E × (1 + H_s) - C × (1 - H_c) + H_fx)
```

Where:
- `E` = Securities (exposure) value
- `H_s` = Securities (volatility) haircut
- `C` = Collateral value
- `H_c` = Collateral haircut
- `H_fx` = FX haircut (if different currencies)

### Standard Supervisory Haircuts

| Asset Type | Residual Maturity | Haircut |
|------------|-------------------|---------|
| Main Index Equity | - | 15% |
| Other Equity | - | 25% |
| Sovereigns (AAA-AA) | ≤1Y | 0.5% |
| Sovereigns (AAA-AA) | 1-5Y | 2% |
| Sovereigns (AAA-AA) | >5Y | 4% |
| Other Sovereigns | ≤1Y | 1% |
| Other Sovereigns | 1-5Y | 3% |
| Other Sovereigns | >5Y | 6% |
| Corporate (IG) | ≤1Y | 1% |
| Corporate (IG) | 1-5Y | 4% |
| Corporate (IG) | >5Y | 8% |

## Risk Considerations

### Gap Risk
Risk that securities price moves faster than margin calls can be collected.

### Correlation Risk
Risk that collateral value is correlated with securities value (wrong-way risk).

### Concentration Risk
Risk from concentrated positions in securities or collateral.

### Operational Risk
Settlement failures, corporate action processing, dividend handling.
