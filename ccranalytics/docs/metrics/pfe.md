# Potential Future Exposure (PFE) Metric

## Definition

PFE is the maximum expected credit exposure at a specified confidence level over a time horizon. It captures tail risk of exposure increases due to adverse market movements.

## Formula

```
PFE(t, α) = Quantileα[max(0, V(t))]

where:
V(t) = Portfolio value at time t
α = Confidence level (typically 95% or 99%)
```

## Key Properties

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Point-in-time | Calculated at each future date |
| Percentile-based | Captures tail of distribution |
| Additive at percentile | PFE profile, not single number |
| Peak PFE | Maximum of PFE profile |

## Confidence Levels

| Purpose | Confidence Level |
|---------|------------------|
| Credit limits | 95% - 97.5% |
| Regulatory capital | 97.5% - 99% |
| Stress testing | 99% - 99.9% |

## Use Cases

### Credit Limits
- Set counterparty credit limits
- Monitor limit utilization
- Approve new trades

### Capital
- Input to regulatory EAD
- Economic capital calculations

### Pricing
- Risk-based pricing adjustments
- Collateral requirements

## Peak vs Average PFE

| Metric | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| Peak PFE | Credit limit management |
| Average PFE | Capital calculation |
| PFE at maturity | Settlement risk |

## Factors Affecting PFE

| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Volatility ↑ | PFE ↑ |
| Maturity ↑ | PFE ↑ (initially) |
| Current MTM ↑ | PFE ↑ |
| Collateral ↑ | PFE ↓ |
| Netting | PFE ↓ |

## Netting Impact

Without netting:
```
Gross PFE = Σᵢ PFEᵢ
```

With netting:
```
Net PFE < Gross PFE

Netting benefit typically 40-70%
```

## Best Practices

1. Calculate at netting set level
2. Use appropriate confidence level for purpose
3. Account for collateral properly
4. Update volatility estimates regularly
5. Include wrong-way risk adjustments
