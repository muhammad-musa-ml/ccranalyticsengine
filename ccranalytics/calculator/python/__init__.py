Pure Python implementations of 14 CCR risk calculators.

Credit Risk Calculators:
- PDCalculator: Probability of Default (Merton, rating-based, reduced-form)
- LGDCalculator: Loss Given Default (workout, market-implied)
- EADCalculator: Exposure at Default (current, regulatory)
- ELCalculator: Expected Loss (EL = PD × LGD × EAD)

Exposure Calculators:
- CECalculator: Current Exposure (MTM, collateral-adjusted)
- PFECalculator: Potential Future Exposure (Monte Carlo, parametric)
- EECalculator: Expected Exposure profile generation
- StressedExposureCalculator: Stress testing scenarios
- PeakExposureCalculator: Maximum exposure calculation

Valuation Adjustment Calculators:
- CVACalculator: Credit Valuation Adjustment
- XVA Calculators: DVA, FVA, KVA, MVA, ColVA

Capital Calculators:
- ECCalculator: Economic Capital (Vasicek, Gordy, IRB)
- RAROCCalculator: Risk-Adjusted Return on Capital
- IMCalculator: Initial Margin (ISDA SIMM)

Regulatory Calculators:
- SACCRCalculator: SA-CCR EAD (Basel III/IV)
