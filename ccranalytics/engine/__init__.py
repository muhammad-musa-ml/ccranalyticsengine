---

High-performance, multi-threaded CCR analytics engine.

Features:
- Concurrent calculator execution via ThreadPoolExecutor
- Multiple implementation support (Python/QuantLib)
- Configurable calculation pipelines
- Real-time analytics processing
- Comprehensive result aggregation
- Batch job processing with priority queues
- Performance benchmarking (Python vs QuantLib)

Components:
- CCREngine: Main orchestrator for CCR calculations
- EngineStatus: Engine state enumeration (IDLE, RUNNING, PAUSED, STOPPED, ERROR)
- CalculationTask: Single calculation task definition
- CalculationJob: Batch of calculation tasks
- TaskResult: Individual task result
- JobResult: Aggregated job results

Usage:
    from ccranalytics.engine import CCREngine
    
    with CCREngine() as engine:
        result = engine.calculate(CalculatorType.CVA, input_data)
        metrics = engine.calculate_ccr_metrics(trade_data)
